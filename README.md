# Terraria Wiki Parser
This program grabs and parses data from the Terraria wiki and then generates JSON files based on the data.

## How to use
You can either download the latest release or compile it yourself through gradle.

Arguments:
<br>
--prettyPrint - Makes the JSON output pretty print
<br>
--advanced - Retrieves extra data from each individual wiki page (this takes a long time).

## Pre Parsed Data
If you would like to get cached data from when I last ran the program (no guarantee this is up-to-date with the wiki)
you can find the JSON files in the cache folder.
